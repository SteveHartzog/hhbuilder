#About

The script is in a separate file for convenience during development.

There are 3 scripts, because I overengineered it... and wanted to play with Html5 validation :frowning:
- `html5.js` is for HTML5 validation
- `standard.js` is for the old way (cleaner IMHO)
- `both.js` It's both with a toggle between (safe to ignore)

Ultimately, I try to keep my code clean and comment sparingly so it's easier to remember how I did it 6mos from now (I always forget).
